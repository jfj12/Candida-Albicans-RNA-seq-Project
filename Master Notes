### 10/29/2024 - Preliminary Sequence Analysis
RNA from biologically-replicated _Candida albicans_ cultures grown in the presence of thiamine were extracted. A sequence library was prepared and ribosomal RNAs were removed 
before being sequenced. Sequencing produced the corresponding read pairs WTC1_.fq.gz and WTC1_2.fq.gz. Fastqc was conducted on the sequence reads and it was determined the 
sequences had poor per-base sequence content and poor sequence duplication levels.
