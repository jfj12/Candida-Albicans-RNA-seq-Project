# _Candida albicans_ RNA-seq Project Abstract
The primary goal of this project is to investigate differential gene expression and function of _Candida albicans_ in the presence and absence of thiamine. In other words, what pathways in _C. albicans_ are affected or regulated by the presence or absence of thiamine? RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data will be used to determine gene transcription under thiamine-rich and poor environments.
