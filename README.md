# RNA seq Project - adjust to contain general background information
## Project Primary Goal
To investigate differential gene expression and function of _Candida albicans_ in the presence and absence of thiamine. In other words, what pathways in _C albicans_ are 
affected or regulated by the presence or absence of thiamine? RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data will be used to determine gene transcription under thiamine-rich and poor environments.
